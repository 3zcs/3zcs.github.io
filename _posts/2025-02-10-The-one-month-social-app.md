## The one month social app

I've been posting about my short weekend trips on Instagram for the past month, and then I thoughtâ€”what if I let my friends suggest ideas for my and there weekend adventures? The idea came from the fact that I have a job and a family, but I also want to travel and have fun.

Thatâ€™s how I came up with the app idea.

Now, I want to build this app, but since itâ€™s a social app, itâ€™s going to take a lot of work and details. So, I sdevelopemnttarted thinking about the easiest way to build it quickly, at least as an MVP. Plus, the idea might not appeal to everyone, so Iâ€™m not sure if people will actually contribute.

## Backend 
I started looking for the fastest way to set up a backend and came across Parse, which is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS). It turned out to be the perfect solution for quickly building an app.

While exploring it, I decided to speed things up even more by dockerizing everything in one YAML file.

```yaml
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: my-mongo-instance
    ports:
      - "27018:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db

  parse-server:
    image: parseplatform/parse-server:latest
    container_name: my-parse-server
    ports:
      - "1337:1337"
    volumes:
      - config-vol:/parse-server/config
      - mya-pp/parse-server/cloud:/parse-server/cloud
    environment:
      - PARSE_SERVER_APPLICATION_ID=nweeknid
      - PARSE_SERVER_MASTER_KEY=mnweeknkey
      - PARSE_SERVER_DATABASE_URI=mongodb://mongo/nweekn
      - PARSE_SERVER_CLOUD=/parse-server/cloud/main.js
      - PARSE_SERVER_MASTER_KEY_IPS=172.18.0.0/16
    depends_on:
      - mongo

  parse-dashboard:
    image: parseplatform/parse-dashboard:latest
    container_name: parse-dashboard
    user: root
    ports:
      - "4040:4040"
    volumes:
    - ./parse-dashboard-config.json:/Parse-Dashboard/parse-dashboard-config.json
    command: ["--config", "/Parse-Dashboard/parse-dashboard-config.json", "--allowInsecureHTTP", "--dev"]
    depends_on:
      - parse-server

volumes:
  mongo-data:
  config-vol:
```

 With that, I can literally spin up the whole backend (MongoDB and Parse Server) with just one click. Iâ€™ll add more improvements later.

This setup lets you start working on your app logic from day one. Plus, since Parse is open-source, you can choose to host it locally or on a server. You also get the flexibility to use a provider like Back4App and even transfer your data between them, which is a nice bonus!

## Frontend 
As a solo dev, I knew it wouldnâ€™t make sense to code separately for each platform, so I went straight for a cross-platform frameworkâ€”and I chose [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). Itâ€™s been around for a while, is well-tested, and backed by Google.

While working on the app, I noticed that certain processesâ€”like the app intro, registration, login, and user profileâ€”were repetitive. So, I started [committing](https://github.com/3zcs/nweekn/commit/ba3827e957669f028d38271c1c6bde68ae0678b2) these features separately, making them reusable for future projects. This way, I can develop new apps much faster, at least for the MVP stage.

When it came to UI/UX, Iâ€™m not an expert, so I went straight to [websites](https://dribbble.com/tags/flutter-ui) that showcase designer ideas and GitHub [repos](https://github.com/olayemii/flutter-ui-kits) where UI creators share their work. I found plenty of [ready-to-use](https://github.com/mitesh77/Best-Flutter-UI-Templates) ideas, and for some, I had to implement them myself.

For icons and images, I found several [websites](https://www.svgrepo.com/) that provide [themed assets](https://www.flaticon.com/stickers-pack/essentials-166), which was super helpful for UI design. The key is knowing what fits your appâ€™s look. Sometimes, you have to try an icon or image, realize it doesnâ€™t match, and keep searching for a better one.

Building an app is an iterative process. You might have a rough idea of how everything should look, but as you work on it, things become clearer. So, donâ€™t overthink itâ€”just start, and as you go, youâ€™ll get a better vision of your project!


## **Landing Page**  

I was looking for a landing page that required minimal editing, and I came across **[Sandoche](https://github.com/sandoche/Mobile-app-landingpage-template)**â€”a beautiful and simple landing page template.  

While building the page, I encountered a few issues. To make deployment easier, I **forked** the project, **Dockerized** it, and used it. You can find the **Dockerized version** along with instructions on how to build and use it [here](https://github.com/3zcs/Mobile-app-landingpage-template/tree/dockrize).

## **Before You Leave**  

- You can check out the app **[Oweekn](https://oweekn.netlify.app/)**.  
- I also wrote another blog post about the **security aspects of this app**, which you can find [here](_posts/2025-02-13-flutter-parse-stack-under-security-lens.md).
